    "This line allows the code within the if statement to run if and only if the module is run directly, as opposed to being imported. The variable `__name__` is defined automatically at runtime. If the module is imported, `__name__` is set to the name of the module. If the module is run directly, e.g. you double click the file, `__name__` is equal to `\"__main__\"`. Therefore we can have the module behave differently if it is imported or run directly. This is useful for testing a module, and is also usually used in the main module of a program to run a function called `main`, as shown below:\n",
